It was [initially\r\ndeveloped](http://www.public-software-group.org/utf8proc) by Jan\r\nBehrens and the rest of the [Public Software\r\nGroup](http://www.public-software-group.org/), who deserve *nearly all\r\nof the credit* for this package.  With the blessing of the Public\r\nSoftware Group, the [Julia developers](http://julialang.org/) have\r\ntaken over development of utf8proc, since the original developers have\r\nmoved to other projects.\r\n\r\n(utf8proc is used for basic Unicode\r\nsupport in the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/), and the Julia\r\ndevelopers became involved because they wanted to add Unicode 7 support and other features.)\r\n\r\nThe utf8proc package is licensed under the\r\nfree/open-source [MIT \"expat\"\r\nlicense](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (plus certain Unicode\r\ndata governed by the similarly permissive [Unicode data\r\nlicense](http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html#Exhibit1)); please see\r\nthe included `LICENSE.md` file for more detailed information.\r\n\r\n## Contact ##\r\n\r\nBug reports, feature requests, and other queries can be filed at\r\nthe [utf8proc issues page on Github](https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc/issues).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
